# Dimbwi

`dimbwi` provides a collection of pools which provide various data types with buffers.

These can be used to lower the number of memory allocations and reuse buffers.
New pools should be added to this package to allow them to be shared across packages.

Utility functions which operate on pools should be added to this package to allow them to be reused.
